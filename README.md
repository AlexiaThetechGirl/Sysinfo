# Sysinfo

Sysinfo is a simple tool I created to allow for the remote collection of system information such as windows version, cpu model, motherboard information and more.
This tool was developed in a way to ensure that (hopefully) discord doesn't ban you since it asks for permsission of the user prior to sending the information. In it's current state it is compliant with discord's community guidelines and terms of service, however I claim no responsibility if you do get banned (for some reason). Enjoy :)
